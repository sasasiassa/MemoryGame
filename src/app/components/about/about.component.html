<p>This site was made by me, Son Mogendorff - an aspiring developer that graduated from John Bryce at the end of 2018</p>
<p>When I started programming I was fascinated by it, so I decided to learn it in a class rather than learning alone.</p>
<p>I mostly like learning new things about programming and helping other people with it.</p>
